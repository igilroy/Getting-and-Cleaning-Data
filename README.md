# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains an R script called “run_analysis.R” which does the following: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Details of the data set can be found in the accompanying CodeBook for this script.
Note: Script assumes data is stored in a "/data" directory under the working directory the script is stored in.
